Newest version is v1.2

### What is BTIKit?

**A handful of helpful classes and categories for iOS Core Data development.**

- Some categories that take the pain out of common Core Data tasks
- Some models that make it easier to manage Core Data behaviors
- A view controller that makes it easy to work with table views and fetched results controllers

### Getting the code

BTICoreDataKit can be cloned from its git repository on github. You can find the repository here: [https://github.com/BriTerIdeas/BTICoreDataKit](https://github.com/BriTerIdeas/BTICoreDataKit)

### Requirements and supported OS versions

- **iOS 6.0** or later (**with ARC**) for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch
- BTICoreDataKit depends upon [BTIKit](http://github.com/BriTerIdeas/BTIKit), which is included via Cocoapods.

### License

The original code portions of BTICoreDataKit are distributed under The MIT License.

### Saying Thank You

If you find this code useful, then any of the following would really make me happy:

- Including some form of attribution would be great. Maybe something like this:
"Includes BTIKit code by Brian Slick, BriTer Ideas LLC"
...along with a link to [http://briterideas.com/](http://briterideas.com/).
- I have an app: [SlickShopper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slickshopper-2/id434077651?mt=8). Buy a copy. Tell friends and family about how great it is so they'll buy copies too. Seriously, I'm lucky to sell one copy a week. You could literally make my month!
- I do contract development: [BriTer Ideas LLC](http://www.briterideas.com/services.shtml). Hire me. Or if you know of anyone else looking for a developer, I'd appreciate a referral.
- A shout out on Twitter never hurt anybody.
- I will graciously accept a [PayPal](http://bit.ly/AW4Cc) donation.

### Sample code

The BTICoreDataKit project includes a simple iPhone demonstration app. What it does isn't as interesting as how it does it, so be sure to review the sample classes.

### Bugs and feature requests

There is very little support offered with this code. I am always interested in better ways of doing things, so I'll be happy to consider feature requests. (Note, "consider" doesn't mean I will do anything).
